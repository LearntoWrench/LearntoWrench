                    <li><strong>LEARN WHAT YOU WANT WHEN YOU WANT</strong>- Want to get into car repair but don't know how to get started or aren't able to take on a strenous 1 or 2 year automotive degree? We teach the repairs you want to learn, that's it. If you only ever want to repair your own brakes and spark plugs, then that's totally fine. There are no commitments. Our mission is to create a context for learning car repair that has never existed before to help anyone willing to learn the specific repairs or diagnostic processes on their own vehicle. &nbsp;</li>
                    <li><strong>LEARN IN YOUR OWN DRIVEWAY OR GARAGE</strong>&nbsp;- Maybe the car can't move, either way, Learn to Wrench teaches it's classes where owners would be fixing them in "the real world" once we aren't there anymore. You don't have to worry about driving a broken car somewhere for a repair or diagnosis. With Learn to Wrench you can learn how to do it yourself where the car is located.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li><strong>INDIVIDUALIZED CLASSES</strong> - Learn to Wrench teaches repairs to specific people on specific cars for the best learning experience and outcomes for our learners as possible.&nbsp;</li>

Is your car overheating? Leaking oil? Certain features no longer working? Spending money on parts without a conclusive diagnosis?<br><br>Learn to Wrench can teach the diagnostic process a technician performs for each specific scenario and vehicle. Depending on the symptom you are experiencing, one class will look much different than another. In some instances the process may involve removing parts, in others it may not be necessary for example. If for any reason LTW teaches the process and the problem is still not identified, Learn to Wrench will not charge any money for the class. That is how confident we are in teaching high quality and conclusive diagnostic classes that work.&nbsp;<br><br>LTW <strong>can </strong>perform can teach many diagnostic processes. Refer to the list below to get a feel for the skills we can teach.<br><br><strong>How to:</strong><br>1. Check diagnostic codes in the car (1996+).<br>2. Identify charging issues.<br>3. Identify engine performance issues.<br>4.Identify overheating issues.<br>5.&nbsp;Identify where any leaks are coming from.<br>6.Identify no start issues.<br>7. Identify electrical problems.&nbsp;<br>8. Pin point misfires.&nbsp;<br>9. Identify concerning driveability symptoms in the steering, suspension, or driveline of the vehicle.<br>10. Perform a compression test.<br><br>Just like with repairs, we can teach most inquiries. Please get in touch with anything you are struggling with!<br><br>That being said, there are certain functions we cannot perform/ teach.<br><br>LTW <strong>cannot</strong>&nbsp;<br>-Perform smoke tests.<br>-Teach any AC diagnostic work.<br>-Road test or ride passenger in any non street legal vehicle.&nbsp;<br></p>

Are you an adventurer who isn't afraid to take a plunge into the unknown? The DIY plunge class is for people who want to learn the entire process, including the diagnosis and the repair. This is usually a two class process. One class for the diagnosis, and another one to install the part. We teach students everything, including how to order parts for their vehicle. Getting parts  may be immediate if we can find them locally, or it may take days to order for them to come in the mail. This process is a rewarding one but takes patience and an open mind! Are you ready to dive into fixing your car?&nbsp;</p>

We do our absolute best to teach every learner on any car they have, but in some situations the car may be so far gone with corrosion that it's not even worth touching the bolts and nuts for example. In these situations LTW will not be able to continue teaching &nbsp;a repair, or even start teaching a repair if everything is likely going to break and cause even worse problems.&nbsp;<br><br>If any other weird and unlikely circumstances happen while working on a car we will do our best to help you resolve them immediately, but in some circumstances it may be just like at the shop where sometimes things break unexpectedly just because you were in there servicing something else. Again all these unwanted issues are more and more likely with age. In these circumstances which has only happened once so far, we can teach another class at another time to remedy the problem, or you could opt to have a professional service the car if you are afraid of your car causing too many problems while in the driveway. If a class is cut short for any reason we only expect payment for how far into the process you were. If something bad happens 40% of the way into the repair we only expect 40% of the class quote as the repair may not be completable at that time.&nbsp;</p>
